# Notes

- Let's recreate this whole app and rebrand it.
- Instead of Hodl, it could be called trustfund or something like that.

## TrustFund

- Should use a factory contract to create fund contracts
- Fund contracts should allow users to deposit any ERC20 token, maybe even NFTs
- Should be able to deposit to a fund as many times as you'd like
- Allow for multisig emergency exit
